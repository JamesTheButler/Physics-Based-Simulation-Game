This project is a proof-of-concept inspired by Activisions 80s classic *Pitfall!*. The interactions and gameplay elements are built using exclusivley a physics-based simulation system.

The character and the vines are comprised of particles that are connected via internal constraints.
Each particles acceleration, velocity and position are evaluated each time step according to external forces and internal constraints. The player can toggle the characters ability to stick to the vines and give force impulses to control the character.
